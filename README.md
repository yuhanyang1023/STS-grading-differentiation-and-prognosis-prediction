# STS-grading-differentiation-and-prognosis-prediction
## Deep-learning Radiomics techniques for classification modelling

### Introduction
This is the code for the paper entitled "Deep learning MRI-based Models for Prediction of Tumor Grading and Clinical Prognosis in Patients with Resectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma"

This code includes feature extraction from pretrained Deep Convolutional Neural Network model and then further model training and validation by machine learning approaches.

### Methods
